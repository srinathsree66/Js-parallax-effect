## Demo

Before you get started, check out the [live demo](https://srinathsree66.github.io/Js-parallax-effect/) to see the parallax effect in action.

## Getting Started

To add the parallax effect to your website, follow these steps:

1. **Include the HTML:** Add the necessary HTML structure to your page. Create a container for the parallax effect and add individual elements (divs, sections, etc.) that you want to apply the effect to.

   ```html
   <div class="parallax-container">
     <div class="parallax-element" data-speed="5"></div>
     <div class="parallax-element" data-speed="7"></div>
     <!-- Add more parallax elements as needed -->
   </div>
2. **Add the CSS:** Create your CSS styles for the parallax elements, including their dimensions, positions, and background images. Style your parallax-container as needed.

3. **Include the JavaScript:** Add the JavaScript code provided in this repository to your project. This code will handle the parallax effect.

4. **Customize:** Adjust the data-speed attribute for each parallax element to control its scrolling speed. You can also customize the JavaScript code to fit your specific needs.

## How it Works
The parallax effect works by altering the position of background elements relative to the user's scroll position. The JavaScript code listens for scroll events and calculates the new position for each parallax element based on its assigned speed. This creates the illusion of depth and motion as the user scrolls.

## Customization
You can customize the parallax effect to fit your design and preferences. Here are some possible customizations:

**Speed:** Adjust the data-speed attribute for each parallax element to make them scroll faster or slower.

**Styles:** Customize the CSS for the parallax elements, container, and any other associated elements to match your website's design.

**Content:** Add content, such as text or additional elements, over the parallax elements to create unique visual effects.

**Events:** Extend the JavaScript code to include additional functionality or interactions based on user actions.
